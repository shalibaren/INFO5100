# 2048 game
### Introduction
2048 is a single-player game created in March 2014 by 19-year-old Italian web developer Gabriele Cirulli, in which the objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048. It can be regarded as a type of sliding block puzzle, and is very similar to the Threes! app released a month earlier.
### Programming Language: Java
### Libraries and Important Functions
- Swing library (for the game UI)
- Java KeyEvents for keylisteners (up, down, left, right) plus a hashmap to map them to functions.
- Custom classes grid and tile
- enum used to store numbers and colors as constants
### Future Improvement
- Create a game counting system for the game, the game can be continuously played if the player is good enough
- Set different difficulty game mode for the game
- The difficulty of the game can be raised by creating larger grid space, setting the goal to value higher than 2048 etc.
